    <h3>About me</h3>
    <img src="assets/images/Philly-square-300-300.jpeg" alt="Profile" width="300" height="300">
    <p>I'm Bailing, living in the University City of Philly now. I come from Beijing, China. I have about 5 years of
      working experience. I like traveling everywhere, and my wish is to go far away and meet different people. I like
      reading in my leisure time, especially like history and culture, and I have great enthusiasm for new things. </p>
    <p>By the way, Chinese language and Chinese history, which are what I am good at. I have won several champions
      in various competitions about them. So, if anybody would have any interest in Chinese, please feel free to
      talk to me.</p>
